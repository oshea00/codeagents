create a cli calculator that runs in a REPL loop and handles basic arithmetic. 
the calculator should support command line history via up/down arrow.
Ensure that operations follow the precedence rules for arithmetic, and handle negative number literals properly, 
keeping in mind that consecutive minus signs can precede a unary expression. 
For example: --3 is equal to 3. 
The negative sign should have higher precedence when preceding a unary expression.
Allow expressions to be inside parentheses.
Provide a help command that explains how to use the calculator. 
The basic arithmetic operations (+,-,/,*) when used to take two arguments should treat multiplication 
and division with higher priority than addition and subtraction. 
When precedent is equal, operations are handled in sequence.
